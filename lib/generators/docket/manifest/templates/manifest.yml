# This file contains the description and settings for your AWS infrastructure to support this app
# In order to actually generate this infrastructure you will need to execute: rake docket:build
#

# Environment comes first
# development:

  # Optional config block, it will try to rely on the Docket config by default but you might want
  # to override specific settings here
  # config:
  #   queues:
  #     endpoint: "http://localhost:6059"
  #   topics:
  #     endpoint: "http://localhost:6061"

  # What queues should we be setting up as part of this manifest
  # queues:

    # Now comes an array of queues that contain:
    # name: (required) the name of the queue, this is an underscored symbol, it's convereted to an ARN in the builder
    # attributes: (optional) aws queue specific attributes, please see the AWS SQS developer guide for information
    # FYI: If you specify a redrive policy with a queue arn as an underscored symbol, the builder will try to determine
    # the ARN of that queue on demand
    # -
    #   name: :my_first_queue
    #   attributes:
    #     MessageRetentionPeriod: 1209600

        # endpoint: (required) Email address, URI, or queue ARN etc. If you supply an underscored symbol as the name, and the protocol is cqs/sqs it will

        # -
        #   protocol: :cqs
